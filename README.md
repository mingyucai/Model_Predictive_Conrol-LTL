## Description

This package contains implementations for online-plan synthesis algorithm give a dynamic
environment (as the finite transition system) and a potential infeasible Linear temporal
logic formula (as the robotâ€™s task). It outputs the predicted trajectories at each
time-step that optimize the reward-related objectives and finally fulfill the task maximumly.

1. In the simlulations, the graph-like environments are tested.

2. In the experiment, the neighbor numbers of simulation snapshot provide the time-varying reward 
(Here we use the random values) which is our optimization objective.

## Features
- Allow both normal and infeasible LTL based product automaton task formulas
- Motion model can be dynamic and initially unknown
- Soft specification is maximumly satisfied.
- Online-Path planning is designed from the model predicted control methodology.
- Collect and transfer the real-time data via Optitrack camera systems 
- Allow automatically calibrate the mobile robots to obtain its orientation and dynamics.

## Debugging
### Ptthon3
* Install python packages like networkx2.0.ply
* Add to your PYTHONPATH, to import it in your own project.
* ltlba_32 and ltlba_64 are executable files complied under Linux, please follow [ltl2ba/README.txt]
```
Try [path_plan.py](https://github.com/mingyucai/Model-Predictive-Control/blob/master/path_plan.py) 
```
### Matlab
* Add folder to your PYTHONPATH.
```
Execute [Receding_Horizon_Control.py](https://github.com/mingyucai/Model-Predictive-Control/blob/master/Matlab_simulation/LTL_MPC/RHC_ACC.m)
```
